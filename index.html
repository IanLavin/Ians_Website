                <div id = "leftpart">
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website! My name is Ian Lavin and I am currently a student attending the  
                    University of Utah. I was born and raised in Eagle Idaho, just outside of the capital of Boise.
                    For the past four years I have been studying electrical engineering with an emphasis on microarchitectures and embedded systems. I
                    am currently pursuing my bachelors degree with future plans to work towards a masters degree. After finishing my degrees, I   
                    plan on working in the industry as a hardware engineer. My ultimate goal would be to one day work as a project manager who oversees a 
                    team of engineers. Hopefully through this website you can get the chance to learn a bit more about me and some of my interests and current projects!
                    </p>

                    <p>There are many things I am interested in and you can learn more by clicking on the tab above. You can also get the chance to learn more about some of the 
                        current projects I have been working on. One of those projects is this very website! I started working on this website as a way to practice and further 
                        develop my coding skills while also getting the chance to show more about me and some of my accomplishments. I hope that you enjoy reading it and feel free
                        free to contact me if you have any questions!

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p2>Music has always been an important part of my life. I first started playing music when I was eight years old and decided 
                        I wanted to play the saxophone. I would go on to play it for ten years and play in jazz bands, symphonic bands, small group 
                        and even solo. I picked up the guitar over four years ago and the keyboard two years after that. I still enjoy playing music
                        on my own and even preforming for others from time to time.

                    <p2>I love applying the engineering principles I learn at school to a wide variety of personal projects I do at home. While 
                        many of these involve the use of microcontrollers and electric circuits there are many other engineering disciplines I have 
                        explored. From building a 3D printer to designing mechanical control systems for maintaining proper Ph level I always 
                        enjoy getting to expand my design skills and learn more about other engineering disciplines.

                        and promote sustainability.I have primarily done this through the design and construction of community hydroponic  
                        systems. These systems focus on providing freshly grown produce directly to local food pantrys. The systems are run
                        by my universities Hydroponic Club which I co-founded during my freshman year.

                    <p2>A more recent hobby I have done for the past two years, winemaking has been a unique and rewarding experience. It started 
                        when I planted a concord grape vine and built a custom trellis support structure for it. Each spring I travel back home to 
                        prune and maintain the vine. It grows over the summer and once fall arrives I return to harvest and begin the process. Once 
                        the fermentation process is complete I finish by bottling and adding a custom label I designed.

                        have visited multiple national parks in southern Utah including Arches and Bryce Canyon. Closer to home, I also enjoy hiking 
                        on the local trails. I also am an avid runner and have been running for years, competing in numerous 5k races and local fun

                        <p>As part of my interest in microcontrollers, recently I have been working on the design of a centralized 
                            integrated home system. Utilizing a raspberry pi, multliple differnt devices will be connected and controlled 
                            in a small internet of things system. This includes a strip of LED lights programmed with custom light animations, 
                            two bedroom speakers, and a monitor with calender display. I additionaly plan to include a window blind opener
                            driven by a stepper motor and a temperature and light sensor for monitoring the health of my houseplants. All 
                            these devices will be connected wirelessly through the use hm-10 bluetooth modules which will serially 
                            transmit and recieve data for local arduinos. On the raspberry pi side, a basic UI has been integrated in  
                            Python and is continually being expanded as new devices are connected.

                    <h3>Hydroponic Module </h3>
                    <p> The design of hydroponic systems is a field I have had a wealth of prior experience in.
                        Numerous system designs already exist and each comes with its own benefits and drawbacks. However one 
                        common issue shared by nearly all systems is scalability and flexibility of design. System size is rigidly 
                        fixed and often involves the use of large inconvenient water tanks. This is why I have been pursuing the design
                        of a modular hydroponic system. Each module will be simple, self containted, and can be combined to scale to any desired size.  
                        In addition, the hydroponic module would combine the ease of use of deep water systems with the area savings of vertical systems.
                        Multiple module designs have been constructed and are currently being tested to measure growth performance and compatability.  </p>
